Custom FoV is a mod that allows players to customize various field of view settings through the configuration file. The current settings allow configuration for flying, aiming, underwater and speed-related field of view changes. The speed-related field of view changes can further be broken down into sprinting and potion effect-related changes.

This mod is client-side only.
