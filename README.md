Custom FoV is a mod that allows players to customize various field of view settings through the configuration file. This mod is client-side only, so it is not required on the server-side to function. The current settings allow configuration for flying, aiming, and speed-related field of view changes. The speed-related field of view changes can further be broken down into sprinting and potion effect-related changes.

# Configuration Options

## Static FoV

Disables any and all vanilla field of view changes resulting from flying, aiming, or speed.

## Each of Flying, Aiming, and Speed (Sprinting/Effects)
* Modifier - A decimal number to multiply by the original FoV modifier, used to soften or strengthen FoV changes
* Max Value - A decimal number that indicates the maximum FoV value allowed for the FoV modifier
